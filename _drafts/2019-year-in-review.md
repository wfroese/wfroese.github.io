description: A review of how my 2019 went
---
I always love reading year-in-review posts from other people. A year is a long enough period of time that a lot can happen if you're intentional about it, or it can just coast by and kind of disappear on you if you're not careful. 

<!--end_excerpt-->

2019 was both challenging and rewarding. I feel like I built up some momentum in the second half of the year, and I'm hoping to continue that into 2020. 

In no particular order, here are the highlights of my year.

## Eleven Winds / Utilismart

**I officially run a team now**. For the last few years I've been basically a Senior Developer, often running projects with one or two other people. I wrote a lot of code and generally took on the hardest projects, while delegating the easier ones and helping train/mentor some of the less experienced developers.

This February I made the jump to a full-on team lead/manager for [Utilismart]( http://www.utilismartcorp.com/ ), a meter data management company, and I now have four developers on my team. I still write code, but only 25% of the time, and my primary responsibility now is figuring out what the business needs us to build, how we're going to build that, and making sure my team members can be productive.

It's been a challenging adjustment, but I do have a tendency to get bored when things get easy, so on the positive side I can't remember the last time I was bored. 

I wrote about [my transition to being responsible for a team]( https://willfroese.com/blog/the-managers-path), and also [what software development is like in the utility industry]( https://willfroese.com/blog/software-development-utility-industry).

**My team launched some major projects this year**. I'm proud of what my team has accomplished this year. We launched some major projects, including:

1. A migration from Oracle to a time-series database was underway - we took this project over, completed it, and launched it. Long story, but this was probably the hardest thing I've ever done at work due to how many things had gone wrong that were out of our control.
2. Rewrote a critical customer-facing Silverlight web app in React and launched it.
3. Lots of other smaller projects including new customer onboardings, etc.
4. Everyone worked sane hours all year long.

## Be Intentional

I made a decision this year (sometime in the Spring) to try being more intentional about my life. I wanted to have more concrete plans and actually follow through on them, rather than wandering aimlessly or just giving in to my emotional state on any given day. 

To do this, I started keeping a notebook where I dedicate one single page per month. At the beginning of the month, I outline what I'm hoping to do in that month. I've had a consistent goal of reading two books per month, but I also dedicate a section to goals at work, anything related to family and friends, and any personal habits I want to kill/create.

At the end of the month I review what my original plans were, check off what I completed, and write down any additional observations about what went well and what didn't, as well as anything else significant (positive or negative) that I might want to remember in the future.

So far, this system is working really well for me. I've been doing more things that I intellectually want to do but have always neglected because I'm inevitably too tired, lazy, or anxious. These are the types of things that I just never feel like doing, but never regret after the fact. 

## Books

I read some really great books this year, both software-related and otherwise. A few of the highlights:

1. [The Manager's Path (Camille Fourner)]( https://willfroese.com/blog/the-managers-path )
2. Software Estimation: Demystifying the Black Art (Steve McConnell)
3. [Designing Data-Intensive Applications (Martin Kleppman)](https://www.amazon.ca/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321) 
4. Foundation (Isaac Asimov) - Known as one of the best sci-fi series of all time, it lived up to it's reputation. 
5. [Foundryside (Robert Jackson Bennett)]( https://www.amazon.com/Foundryside-Novel-Founders-Trilogy-Book-ebook/dp/B077RG422Z/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=foundryside&qid=1573960027&sr=8-1 ) - A sci-fi/fantasy that actually manages to be unique, and the start of a new series.

## Fitness

This was a bit of a mixed bag, unfortunately. I've wanted to get stronger for years now, but every time I try I remember how much I dislike the gym. I'm trying again anyway, with a bit of extra motivation since I've turned 30 now. I'm also really starting to feel how my office job is affecting me, as I've lost a lot of flexibility over the last few years. I've had some success with getting to the gym more regularly in the last few months, so I'm hoping to continue that into next year.

One positive was that I played baseball the entire summer with no injuries, which hasn't happened in a couple years. These days I don't have time to be out several times a week, so all I do is pitch, usually every 10-14 days for so. The last few years I've had arm injuries, but this year was clean!

## Goals

I didn't have any goals at the beginning of 2019, so everything I accomplished was a bonus!

## 2020
I have some plans, to be detailed in an upcoming post - stay tuned!
