description: A review of how my 2019 went
---
I always love reading year-in-review posts from other people. A year is a long enough period of time that a lot can happen if you're intentional about it, or it can just coast by and kind of disappear on you if you're not careful. 

<!--end_excerpt-->

2019 was both challenging and rewarding. I feel like I built up some momentum in the second half of the year, and I'm hoping to continue that into 2020. 

In no particular order, here are the highlights of my year.

## Eleven Winds / Utilismart

**I officially run a full team now**. For the last few years I've been basically a Senior Developer, often running projects with one or two other people. I wrote a lot of code and generally took on the hardest tasks, while delegating the easier ones and helping train/mentor some of the less experienced developers.

This February I made the jump to a full-on team lead/manager for Utilismart, a meter data management company, and I now have four developers on my team. I still write code, but only 25% of the time, and my primary responsibility now is figuring out what the business needs us to build and making sure my team members can be productive.

It's been a challenging adjustment, but I do have a tendency to get bored when things get easy, so on the positive side I can't remember the last time I was bored. 

**I lead the launch of some major projects**. I'm proud of what my team has accomplished this year. We launched some major projects, including:

1. A migration from Oracle to a time-series database was underway - we took this project over, completed it, and launched it. Long story, but this was probably the hardest thing I've ever done at work.
2. Rewrote a critical customer-facing Silverlight web app in React and launched it.
3. Lots of other smaller projects.
4. Everyone worked sane hours all year long.

## Be Intentional

I made a decision this year (sometime in the Spring) to try being more intentional about my life. I wanted to have more concrete plans and actually follow through on them, rather than wandering aimlessly or just giving in to my emotional state on any given day. 

To do this, I started keeping a notebook where I dedicate one single page per month. At the beginning of the month, I outline what I'm hoping to do in that month. I've had a consistent goal of reading two books per month, but I also dedicate a section to goals at work, anything related to family and friends, and any personal habits I want to kill/create.

At the end of the month I review what my original plans were, check off what I completed, and write down any additional observations about what went well and what didn't, as well as anything else significant (positive or negative) that I might want to remember in the future.

So far, this system is working really well for me. I've been doing more things that I intellectually want to do but have always neglected because I'm inevitably too tired, lazy, or anxious. These are the types of things that I just never feel like doing, but never regret after the fact.

## Goals
I didn't have any goals at the beginning of 2019, so everything I accomplished was a bonus!
