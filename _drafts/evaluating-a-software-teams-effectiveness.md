Factors that affect software team performance:
1. Skill of the team members
2. State of the software and infrastructure that has been built to support processes
3. Organizational decision-making 
    - management's ability to decide on and agree to priorities, then follow through


Software & infrastructure performance indicators

2. How long does it take to fix a small bug?
3. How often are deployments happening?
4. Presence of automated tests - unit, integration, etc
5. How many different stacks/tools are in use?
6. How up-to-date are stacks/frameworks/libraries/OS's (any other major sources of technical debt)
7. How much downtime has the system had in the last year?
8. How many bugs are customers reporting?

People performance indicators
1. Balanced levels of experience
2. Skills across all necessary stacks/tools
3. Ability to withstand team members leaving
4. Emotional IQ of the team
5. Domain experience

Processes

Organizational performance indicators

    concrete enough to start building?
2. How long does it take for something to be approved in UAT to go live?
