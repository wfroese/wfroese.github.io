# Windsor Software Companies & Jobs
I thought it might be useful to compile a list of local companies in the Windsor area that have software or web developers on staff. 
The purpose of the list is to help people get to know our local software landscape a bit better, but also to help students and anyone else
who is looking to get into the field.

Windsor isn't known as a tech city, but the software industry is growing and there are opportunities around, if you know where to look for them.
Unfortunately, many people just aren't aware, and don't know where to look for them, so they assume they have to head out of the city.

Note 1: I only have a vague idea of what many of these companies actually do - if you want something a bit more accurate, check out their websites or get in touch with them, rather than relying on my description.

Note 2: This is of course not a complete list, but it does include the majority of local software companies.
